# DESIGN-OF-FINITE-IMPULSE-RESPONSE-BAND-STOP-FILTER
This projects explains how I created a FIR band stop filter using Kaiser window method.
Steps are structured in a sequential manner for better understanding. I used Matlab 2017a
to do all the designing part. Further, the filter is evaluated for its performance by analysing
the output signal obtained for a given input consisting of a combination of sinusoids. I did
this evaluation to the designed filter and ideal filter,then compared both the results.

I have included the report which consists the complete procedure used for designing a Finite-Duration
Impulse Response (FIR) bandstop filter for a set of prescribed specifications and its
implementation on MatLAB 2017a. This digital filter is designed for the prescribed specifications
using the Fourier Series method. The truncations of the impulse response are achieved using the
Kaiser Window function. The report analyses the magnitude and impulse responses of the filter to
confirm its characteristics with initial parameter. Further, the filter is evaluated for its
performance by analysing the output signal obtained for a given input consisting of a combination
of sinusoids
